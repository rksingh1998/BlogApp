An implementation of REST(representation state transfer),total seven types of routes are implemented using nodejs express framework and other dependencies and mongodb as database.

The 7 RESTful routes are as follows:
1) index route   /blogs
2) new route     /blogs/new
3) create route  /blogs
4) show route    /blogs/:id
5) edit route    /blogs/:id/edit
